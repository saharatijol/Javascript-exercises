/*Write a function which will select a random name from a list of names. The person
selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
**Important: The output should be returned from the function and you do not need alert, prompt or console.log.
The output should match the example output exactly.

Example Input :
["Angela", "Ben", "Jenny", "Michael, Chloe"]

Example Output:
Michael is going to buy lunch today!

Hint: You might need to think about Array.length
